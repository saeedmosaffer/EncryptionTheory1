This repository contains a Java implementation of a small application for steganography using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique. 
The primary goal of this project is to securely transfer a secret message from a sender to a receiver within an image while maintaining the quality of the cover file. 
Additionally, the project includes a watermarking feature using LSB.
